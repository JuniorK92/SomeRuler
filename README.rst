QkRuler
=======

An on-screen pixel ruler for Desktop.

The project is inspired by `Ruler
<https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=ruler>`_ developed by Jeff Key. I re-implemented it with Qt, and did some major improvements.

Features & usage:

* Cross platform (tested under Windows 10 and Mac OS X)
* High DPI support
* Can serve as a protractor
* Resize: drag the circle handle horizontally
* Rotation: drag the circle handle upward or downward
* Reading: click on the tick to read the value
* Reset: double click on the circle handle
* Hide: press ESC key
